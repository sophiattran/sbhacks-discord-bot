Stress is a common battle that most college students deal with. Academic pressure, homesickness, and social struggles are among the most common causes of procrastination, depression, anxiety, and other mental illnesses. Sometimes, all we need are some words of encouragement, fun space facts, or cute dogs to put a smile on our faces. Or maybe we need a tool to help you keep track of our daily responsibilities.
